This method involves comparing each new data point to the average of a specified number of preceding values. By smoothing out short-term fluctuations, it becomes easier to identify deviations that may indicate a potential trend shift or anomaly.\n\n<br>\n\nHowever, this method has some limitations. It is sensitive to the chosen window size, can introduce lag, and may struggle to account for seasonality or sudden changes in the data.\n:::\n::::\n:::::\n\n::: {.column-page .binom}\nAn alternative method to detect trends more robustly is a **binomial trend detection approach**, which uses a week-over-week (WoW) comparison. This is how the method can be implemented:\n\n| **Step** | **Details** |\n|----|----|\n| **Calculate WoW Deltas** | Compute the week-over-week changes (deltas) for the metric of interest. This involves determining whether the metric has increased or decreased each day. |\n| **Rolling 2-Week Window** | For each day, consider the previous 14-day period (2 weeks) as a rolling timeframe for analysis. This helps smooth out short-term variations while being responsive to recent changes. |\n| **Counting Positive and Negative Days** | Within the 14-day window, count the number of days where the WoW delta is positive and the number of days where it is negative. This provides insight into the recent performance pattern. |\n| **Binomial Distribution** | Assume that each day has an equal 50% chance of having either a positive or negative WoW delta. Under this assumption, the 14-day window is treated as 14 independent trials, each with a 50% probability of being positive or negative. |\n| **Trend Threshold** | Set a threshold to identify significant trends: for example, if 12 or more out of the 14 days show a consistent direction (either positive or negative), it is deemed statistically significant according to the binomial distribution. |\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-page}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"show\"}\nbinom.test(12, 14, 1/2, alternative = \"greater\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n\tExact binomial test\n\ndata:  12 and 14\nnumber of successes = 12, number of trials = 14, p-value = 0.00647\nalternative hypothesis: true probability of success is greater than 0.5\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.6146103 1.0000000\nsample estimates:\nprobability of success \n             0.8571429 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.column-page .binom}\nThis threshold helps ensure that the observed trend is not due to random fluctuations, but rather indicates a consistent pattern.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-page}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/binom-visual-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.column-page .binom}\nThis binomial approach balances longer rolling windows, reduces sensitivity to day-of-week variations, and adjusts to recent trends more effectively than simple rolling averages.\n:::",

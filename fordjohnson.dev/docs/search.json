    "text": "A Binomial Approach\nAn alternative method to detect trends more robustly is a binomial trend detection approach, which uses a week-over-week (WoW) comparison. This method works as follows:\n\nCalculate WoW Deltas\nCompute the week-over-week changes (deltas) for the metric of interest. This involves determining whether the metric has increased or decreased each day.\n\n\nRolling 2-Week Window\nFor each day, consider the previous 14-day period (2 weeks) as a rolling timeframe for analysis. This helps smooth out short-term variations while being responsive to recent changes.\n\n\nCounting Positive and Negative Days\nWithin the 14-day window, count the number of days where the WoW delta is positive and the number of days where it is negative. This provides insight into the recent performance pattern.\n\n\nBinomial Distribution\nAssume that each day has an equal 50% chance of having either a positive or negative WoW delta. Under this assumption, the 14-day window is treated as 14 independent trials, each with a 50% probability of being positive or negative.\n\n\nTrend Threshold\nSet a threshold to identify significant trends: for example, if 12 or more out of the 14 days show a consistent direction (either positive or negative), it is deemed statistically significant according to the binomial distribution."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Binomial Trend Detection\n\n\n\n\nOne common approach to highlighting trends and detecting anomalies is rolling average benchmarking. This method involves comparing each new data point to the average of a specified number of preceding values. By smoothing out short-term fluctuations, it becomes easier to identify deviations that may indicate a potential trend shift or anomaly.\n\nHowever, this method has some limitations. It is sensitive to the chosen window size, can introduce lag, and may struggle to account for seasonality or sudden changes in the data.\n\n\n\n\nAn alternative method to detect trends more robustly is a binomial trend detection approach, which uses a week-over-week (WoW) comparison. This is how the method can be implemented:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep\nDetails\n\n\n\n\nCalculate WoW Deltas\nCompute the week-over-week changes (deltas) for the metric of interest. This involves determining whether the metric has increased or decreased each day.\n\n\nRolling 2-Week Window\nFor each day, consider the previous 14-day period (2 weeks) as a rolling timeframe for analysis. This helps smooth out short-term variations while being responsive to recent changes.\n\n\nCounting Positive and Negative Days\nWithin the 14-day window, count the number of days where the WoW delta is positive and the number of days where it is negative. This provides insight into the recent performance pattern.\n\n\nBinomial Distribution\nAssume that each day has an equal 50% chance of having either a positive or negative WoW delta. Under this assumption, the 14-day window is treated as 14 independent trials, each with a 50% probability of being positive or negative.\n\n\nTrend Threshold\nSet a threshold to identify significant trends: for example, if 12 or more out of the 14 days show a consistent direction (either positive or negative), it is deemed statistically significant according to the binomial distribution.\n\n\n\n\nbinom.test(12, 14, 1/2, alternative = \"greater\")\n\n\n    Exact binomial test\n\ndata:  12 and 14\nnumber of successes = 12, number of trials = 14, p-value = 0.00647\nalternative hypothesis: true probability of success is greater than 0.5\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.6146103 1.0000000\nsample estimates:\nprobability of success \n             0.8571429 \n\n\nThis threshold helps ensure that the observed trend is not due to random fluctuations, but rather indicates a consistent pattern.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(showtext)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\nshowtext_auto()\nshowtext_opts(dpi = 300)\n\nfont_add_google(name = \"Roboto\", family = \"Roboto\")\nfont_1 &lt;- \"Roboto\"\n\nn &lt;- 14 \np &lt;- 1/2  \nx_obs &lt;- 12  \n\nbinom_test &lt;- binom.test(x_obs, n, p, alternative = \"greater\")\n\np_value &lt;- binom_test$p.value\nconf_int &lt;- binom_test$conf.int\n\np_ge_x_obs &lt;- sum(dbinom(x_obs:n, size = n, prob = p))\n\ndata &lt;- data.frame(\n  x = 0:n,\n  probability = dbinom(0:n, size = n, prob = p),\n  color = ifelse(0:n &gt;= x_obs, \"#C0392B\", \"#30394F\")  \n)\n\nbinom_visual &lt;- ggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = probability, fill = color)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  scale_fill_identity() +  \n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 0:n) +  \n  labs(\n    title = \"Binomial Distribution (n = 14, p = 0.5)\",\n    x = \"Number of Successes\",\n    y = \"Probability\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.margin = margin(10, 10, 10, 10, \"mm\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(family = font_1, size = 7),\n    axis.title = element_text(family = font_1, size = 7),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(margin = margin(5, 0, 0, 0, 'mm')),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(0, 5, 0, 0, 'mm')),\n    plot.title = element_text(family = font_1, size = 10)\n  ) +\n  annotate(\n    geom = 'richtext',\n    x = n+1,\n    y = max(data$probability) * 0.9,\n    label = paste0(\n      \"&lt;span style='color:#C0392B; font-size:8pt;font-family:Roboto;'&gt;\",\n      \"Threshold ≥ 12 trials (days)\", \"&lt;br&gt;\",\n      \"P(X ≥ \", x_obs, \") = \", round(p_ge_x_obs, 4), \"&lt;br&gt;\",\n      \"95% CI = [\", round(conf_int[1], 4), \", \", round(conf_int[2], 4), \"]&lt;/span&gt;\"),\n    hjust = 1, fill = NA, label.color = NA\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis binomial approach balances longer rolling windows, reduces sensitivity to day-of-week variations, and adjusts to recent trends more effectively than simple rolling averages."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Euclidean Distance Between Vectors\n\n\n\n\nMeasuring similarity and difference between data points is essential for analysis. One effective approach is Euclidean distance, which quantifies how far apart two sets of values are. By calculating the sum of the squares of differences between corresponding elements, we can easily determine which points are most similar or different, helping to reveal patterns and inform decision-making.\n\n\n\n\nIn TidyTuesday’s 06/06/2023 dataset, which featured various energy metrics by country and year, we can use Euclidean distance to find the countries most similar (or different) to a target country for a given metric, such as electricity generation.\nThis method allows us to compare a target country’s electricity generation to others and compute a similarity score that quantifies how closely each country aligns with the target.\n\nWhy might you want to know which countries are similar?\nThis type of analysis serves as a baseline to identify the impact of changes over time. For example, in a business context, this could involve comparing KPIs across market subsets to assess the effectiveness of a targeted marketing campaign. If one subset shows a significant change, we can check if others experienced a similar trend.\nFor this example, I’m interested in Germany’s electricity generation. Using Euclidean distance, I’ll compare electricity generation across all countries and find the five most similar and five most different from Germany. A lower Euclidean distance means a country is more similar to Germany, while a higher score indicates greater dissimilarity.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nowid_energy &lt;- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-06-06/owid-energy.csv')\n\ncountries &lt;- c(\n  \"CAN\", \"MEX\", \"BLZ\", \"CRI\", \"SLV\", \"GTM\", \"HND\",\n  \"NIC\", \"PAN\", \"BHS\", \"BRB\", \"CUB\", \"DOM\", \"HTI\",\n  \"JAM\", \"TTO\",\"ALB\", \"AND\", \"ARM\", \"AUT\", \"AZE\",\n  \"BLR\", \"BEL\", \"BIH\", \"BGR\", \"HRV\", \"CYP\", \"CZE\",\n  \"DNK\", \"EST\", \"FIN\", \"FRA\", \"GEO\", \"USA\", \"GRC\",\n  \"HUN\", \"ISL\", \"IRL\", \"ITA\", \"KAZ\", \"LVA\", \"LIE\",\n  \"LTU\", \"LUX\", \"MLT\", \"MDA\", \"MCO\", \"MNE\", \"NLD\",\n  \"MKD\", \"NOR\", \"POL\", \"PRT\", \"ROU\", \"RUS\", \"SMR\",\n  \"SRB\", \"SVK\", \"SVN\", \"ESP\", \"SWE\", \"CHE\", \"UKR\",\n  \"GBR\", \"VAT\"\n)\n\nelectricity_generation &lt;- owid_energy %&gt;%\n  select(country, iso_code, year, electricity_generation) %&gt;%\n  filter(year &gt; 2000 & iso_code %in% countries)\n\ntarget_country &lt;- \"DEU\" # Germany's 3 letter ISO country code\n\ntarget_country_generation &lt;- owid_energy %&gt;%\n  filter(year &gt; 2000 & year &lt; 2021 & iso_code == target_country) %&gt;%\n  select(year, electricity_generation) %&gt;%\n  rename(target_generation = electricity_generation)\n\ncountries_with_similarity_score &lt;- electricity_generation %&gt;%\n  left_join(target_country_generation, by = \"year\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(country, iso_code) %&gt;%\n  summarize(euclidean_distance = sqrt(sum((electricity_generation - target_generation)^2, na.rm = TRUE))) %&gt;%\n  arrange(euclidean_distance)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n# Groups:   country [6]\n  country        iso_code euclidean_distance\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Canada         CAN                    101.\n2 France         FRA                    253.\n3 United Kingdom GBR                   1141.\n4 Italy          ITA                   1454.\n5 Spain          ESP                   1513.\n6 Mexico         MEX                   1571.\n\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n# Groups:   country [6]\n  country       iso_code euclidean_distance\n  &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Malta         MLT                   2744.\n2 Bahamas       BHS                   2745.\n3 Barbados      BRB                   2749.\n4 Haiti         HTI                   2750.\n5 Belize        BLZ                   2751.\n6 United States USA                  15297.\n\n\n\nThe tables above show the countries most and least similar to Germany in terms of electricity generation trends. The most similar countries include Canada, France, and the United Kingdom, while the least similar countries range from Malta and the Bahamas to the United States.\nIn a business context, this type of analysis can help establish a baseline for performance across similar markets. For instance, if you introduce a new policy or product in Germany, you could track Germany’s performance over time and compare it to the performance of these similar countries, both before and after the change. This would allow you to assess the effectiveness of the change and identify whether it led to any measurable impact that’s unique to Germany, or if similar trends occurred in comparable markets.\nNow, let’s look at the visual. The chart highlights electricity generation trends for Germany, Canada, and France in color, showing how closely their trends align, while other countries are represented with gray lines. This setup can be applied in a business context to monitor the impact of strategic changes.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(showtext)\nlibrary(htmltools)\nlibrary(gghighlight)\n\nshowtext_auto()\nshowtext_opts(dpi = 600)\n\nfont_add_google(name = \"Roboto\", family = \"Roboto\")\nfont &lt;- \"Roboto\"\n\ntitle &lt;- paste0(\n  \"&lt;span&gt;Highlighting Countries Similar to&lt;span style='color:#6929c4;'&gt; Germany&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\"\n)\n\nsubtitle &lt;- paste0(\n  \"&lt;span&gt;Electric Generation - Terawatt hours (2000-2020)&lt;/span&gt;\"\n)\n\nsimilar_highlighted_plot &lt;- owid_energy %&gt;%\n  filter(iso_code %in% countries | iso_code == 'DEU') %&gt;%\n  filter(year &gt; 2000 & year &lt; 2021 & iso_code != 'USA') %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = electricity_generation, group = iso_code, color = iso_code)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  gghighlight(iso_code %in% c('DEU', 'FRA', 'CAN'), \n              use_direct_label = FALSE) +\n  labs(\n    title = title,\n    subtitle = subtitle,\n    y = \"Terawatt hours (TWh)\",\n    x = \"Year\"\n  ) +\n    scale_color_manual(\n    values = c('DEU' = '#6929c4', 'FRA' = '#1192e8', 'CAN' = '#198038', 'Other' = '#D3D3D3'),\n    labels = c('DEU' = 'Germany', 'FRA' = 'France', 'CAN' = 'Canada')\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 1100, by = 250)) +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"right\",\n    legend.title = element_blank(),\n    axis.text = element_text(\n      family = font,\n      size = 13\n    ),\n    axis.title = element_text(\n      family = font,\n      size = 13\n    ),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(\n      margin = margin(7,0,0,0,\"mm\")\n    ),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(\n      angle = 90,\n      margin = margin(0,7,0,0,\"mm\")\n    ),\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = \"#e0e0e0\", linewidth = 0.1),\n    legend.text = element_text(\n      family = font,\n      size = 15\n    ),\n    plot.title = ggtext::element_textbox_simple(\n      family = font,\n      size = 20,\n      margin = margin(10,0,0,0)\n    ),\n    plot.subtitle = ggtext::element_textbox_simple(\n      family = font,\n      size = 15,\n      margin = margin(10,0,0,0)\n    ),\n    plot.margin = margin(5,5,5,5, \"mm\")\n  )"

    "text": "Matchmaking Rating (MMR) and Skill Rating\nMost Rocket League players interested in their competitive ranking are familiar with the skill rating displayed on third-party websites or in BakkesMod. This skill rating is derived from the matchmaking rank (MMR), which remains hidden and is not easily visible to players.\n\n\\text{mmr} \\approx \\frac{\\left(\\text{skill rating} - 100\\right)}{20}\n\n\n\\text{skill rating} \\approx \\left(20\\text{mmr}\\right) - 100\n\nThe MMR is the underlying numerical value that determines a player’s true skill level, influencing matchmaking and overall competitive performance in Rocket League. Both casual and competitive matchmaking in Rocket League utilize skill-based matchmaking, meaning that wins and losses directly affect your skill value, leading to increases or decreases in your ranking. To balance the time spent finding eligible opponents within selected regions and prevent long wait times, the game expands the allowable skill range when necessary. Different playlists and gamemodes will have their own MMR value.\n\nDetermining a Player’s Skill\nRocket League uses the SkillMu and SkillSigma to calculate a player’s MMR. This is similar to other Bayesian approaches but not the same.1\n\nSkillMu (Mu)\n\nThe perceived skill level of a player, which increases with wins and decreases with losses. It starts at a value of 25 in unplayed playlists.\n\nSkillSigma (Sigma)\n\nThe “uncertainty” value that decreases with each match, indicating the system’s confidence in a player’s skill. It starts at 8.333 in unplayed playlists and decreases as matches are played to a minimum of 2.5. A lower Sigma signifies greater certainty a player is at the correct skill level.\n\n\nNew players start with a SkillMu = 25, skill rating = 600 and SkillSigma = 8.333.\n\n\nMatchmaking and Teams\nIn competitive Rocket League, players can choose between the following gamemodes:2 1v1, 2v2, 3v3.\nThe matchmaking system employs a weighted average approach, using methods like the root mean square (RMS), to assess each team’s skill and ensure fair matchups against opponents.3\n\n\\text{Team Skill}=\\sqrt[n]{\\frac{\\mathrm{\\text{mmr}}_{1}^{n}+\\mathrm{\\text{mmr}}_{2}^{n}+\\text{...}+\\mathrm{\\text{mmr}}_{x}^{n} }{x}}\n\n\nparty_matchmaking &lt;- function(mmr_arr, n) {\n  party_mmr &lt;- round((sum(mmr_arr^n) / length(mmr_arr))^(1/n),0)\n  return(paste0(\"Team's Skill Rating = \", party_mmr))\n}\n\nplayer_1_mmr = 600\nplayer_2_mmr = 700\nn = 15 # this is the value for competitive playlists\n\nteam_skill &lt;- party_matchmaking(c(player_1_mmr, player_2_mmr), n)\n\nteam_skill\n\n[1] \"Team's Skill Rating = 673\"\n\n\nWhen a player’s skill reaches a certain threshold, the matchmaking system adjusts by basing the team’s skill level entirely on the high skilled player, even if they are partied with lower-skilled teammates. This ensures that the match remains competitive despite skill imbalances within the team."
